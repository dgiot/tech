title: Multi-touch Scale Shape
---

Note: This lab only works on devices that support multi-touch gestures such as iOS because it makes use of multiple touch events.

Instructions: Using a mobile device that supports multi-touch gestures such as iOS, drag and drop a shape by touching it and then dragging your finger across the screen, activate a shape by tapping on it, and scale an active shape by pinching the screen.
